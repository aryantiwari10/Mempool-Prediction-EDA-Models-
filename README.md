# Mempool-Prediction-EDA-Models-

PROJECT TITLE : Memepool Prediction

GOAL : To predict about the memepool in detail.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/aryantiwari123/memepool

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Memepool dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model In each algo I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot ,Regplot etc.

ACCURACIES OF DIFFERENT MODELS ARE:

KNeighbors Classifier= 36 %

Decision Tree Classifier= 33 %

Random Forest Classifier= 100 %

Bagging Classifier = 39 %

Extra Trees Classifier= 100 %

LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

CONCLUSION :

We got a good accuracy of about 100 % using Random Forest Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier which is quite well for the given dataset.

The accuracy of other models can be increased further by HyperTuning.
